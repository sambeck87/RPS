    <h1 class="center">ROCK PAPER SCISSORS</h1><br>
    <p>This is the clasic -Rock Paper Scissors- game.</p>
    <p>Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating from China. It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
